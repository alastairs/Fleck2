That's all.

The commit: https://github.com/git-thinh/Fleck2/commit/0c27bee5c6de75fc1342f9f2325428ac4baea8c0

Was been added to another branch: https://github.com/username1565/Fleck2/tree/Fleck2_without_dll

There can be compiled Fleck2.Demo.exe which is working without dlls.






I cann't fork another fork to another branch, so all files from this branch will be deleted now.
After this, the source code will be uploaded from https://github.com/luckyrat/Fleck2
from commit last commit https://github.com/luckyrat/Fleck2/commit/507038f1d0950b59d502a98ce1be767791a3386a
and after this, I'll add "changes and additions" to make this working.
